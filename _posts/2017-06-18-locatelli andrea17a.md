title: Adaptivity to Noise Parameters in Nonparametric Active Learning
abstract: 'This work addresses various open questions in the theory of active learning
  for nonparametric classification.  Our contributions are both statistical and algorithmic:
  \beginitemize \item We establish new minimax-rates for active learning under common
  \textitnoise conditions. These rates display interesting transitions – due to the
  interaction between noise \textitsmoothness and margin – not present in the passive
  setting. Some such transitions were previously conjectured, but remained unconfirmed.  \item
  We present a generic algorithmic strategy for adaptivity to unknown noise smoothness
  and margin; our strategy achieves optimal rates in many general situations; furthermore,
  unlike in previous work, we avoid the need for \textitadaptive confidence sets,
  resulting in strictly milder distributional requirements. \enditemize'
