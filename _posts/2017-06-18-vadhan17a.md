title: On Learning vs. Refutation
abstract: Building on the work of Daniely et al. (STOC 2014, COLT 2016), we study
  the connection between computationally efficient PAC learning and refutation of
  constraint satisfaction problems.  Specifically, we prove that for every concept
  class $\mathcalP$, PAC-learning $\mathcalP$ is \em polynomially equivalent to “random-right-hand-side-refuting”
  (“RRHS-refuting”) a dual class $\mathcalP^*$, where RRHS-refutation of a class $\mathcalQ$
  refers to refuting systems of equations where the constraints are (worst-case) functions
  from the class $\mathcalQ$ but the right-hand-sides of the equations are uniform
  and independent random bits. The reduction from refutation to PAC learning can be
  viewed as an abstraction of (part of) the work of Daniely, Linial, and Shalev-Schwartz
  (STOC 2014). The converse, however, is new, and is based on a combination of techniques
  from pseudorandomness (Yao ‘82) with boosting (Schapire ‘90).  In addition, we show
  that PAC-learning the class of $\mathitDNF$ formulas is polynomially equivalent
  to PAC-learning its dual class $\mathitDNF^*$, and thus PAC-learning $\mathitDNF$
  is equivalent to RRHS-refutation of $\mathitDNF$, suggesting an avenue to obtain
  stronger lower bounds for PAC-learning $\mathitDNF$ than the quasipolynomial lower
  bound that was obtained by Daniely and Shalev-Schwartz (COLT 2016) assuming the
  hardness of refuting $k$-SAT.
