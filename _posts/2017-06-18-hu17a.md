title: Quadratic Upper Bound for Recursive Teaching Dimension of Finite VC Classes
abstract: 'In this work we study the quantitative relation between the recursive teaching
  dimension (RTD) and the VC dimension (VCD) of concept classes of finite sizes. The
  RTD of a concept class $\mathcal C⊆{0,1}^n$ , introduced by Zilles et al. (2011),
  is a combinatorial complexity measure characterized by the worst-case number of
  examples necessary to identify a concept in $\mathcal C$ according to the recursive
  teaching model. For any finite concept class $\mathcal C⊆{0,1}^n$ with $\mathrm{VCD}(\mathcal
  C) = d$, Simon and Zilles (2015) posed an open problem $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) =
  O(d)$, i.e., is RTD linearly upper bounded by VCD? Previously, the best known result
  is an exponential upper bound $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d\cdot2^d)$, due to Chen
  et al. (2016). In this paper, we show a quadratic upper bound: $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal
  C) = O(d^2)$, much closer to an answer to the open problem. We also discuss the
  challenges in fully solving the problem.'
