title: Fast rates for online learning in Linearly Solvable Markov Decision Processes
abstract: 'We study the problem of online learning in a class of Markov decision processes
  known as \emphlinearly solvable MDPs. In the stationary version of this problem,
  a learner interacts with its environment by directly controlling the state transitions,
  attempting to balance a fixed state-dependent cost and a certain smooth cost penalizing
  extreme control inputs. In the current paper, we consider an online setting where
  the state costs may change arbitrarily between consecutive rounds, and the learner
  only observes the costs at the end of each respective round. We are interested in
  constructing algorithms for the learner that guarantee small regret against the
  best stationary control policy chosen in full knowledge of the cost sequence. Our
  main result is showing that the smoothness of the control cost enables the simple
  algorithm of \emphfollowing the leader to achieve a regret of order $\log^2 T$ after
  $T$ rounds, vastly improving on the best known regret bound of order $T^3/4$ for
  this setting. '
