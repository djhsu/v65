title: Generalization for Adaptively-chosen Estimators via Stable Median
abstract: Datasets are often reused to perform multiple statistical analyses in an
  adaptive way, in which each analysis may depend on the outcomes of previous analyses
  on the same dataset. Standard statistical guarantees do not account for these dependencies
  and little is known about how to provably avoid overfitting and false discovery
  in the adaptive setting. We consider a natural formalization of this problem in
  which the goal is to design an algorithm that, given a limited number of i.i.d.Â samples
  from an unknown distribution, can answer adaptively-chosen queries about that distribution.
  We present an algorithm that estimates the expectations of $k$ arbitrary adaptively-chosen
  real-valued estimators using a number of samples that scales as $\sqrt{k}$. The answers
  given by our algorithm are essentially as accurate as if fresh samples were used
  to evaluate each estimator. In contrast, prior work yields error guarantees that
  scale with the worst-case sensitivity of each estimator. We also give a version
  of our algorithm that can be used to verify answers to such queries where the sample
  complexity depends logarithmically on the number of queries $k$ (as in the reusable
  holdout technique). Our algorithm is based on a simple approximate median algorithm
  that satisfies the strong stability guarantees of differential privacy. Our techniques
  provide a new approach for analyzing the generalization guarantees of differentially
  private algorithms.
