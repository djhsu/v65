title: Testing Bayesian Networks
abstract: This work initiates a systematic investigation of testing \em high-dimensional
  structured distributions by focusing on testing \em Bayesian networks â€“ the prototypical
  family of directed graphical models. A Bayesian network is defined by a directed
  acyclic graph, where we associate a random variable with each node. The value at
  any particular node is conditionally independent of all the other non-descendant
  nodes once its parents are fixed. Specifically, we study the properties of identity
  testing and closeness testing of Bayesian networks. Our main contribution is the
  first non-trivial efficient testing algorithms for these problems and corresponding
  information-theoretic lower bounds. For a wide range of parameter settings, our
  testing algorithms have sample complexity \em sublinear in the dimension and are
  sample-optimal, up to constant factors.
