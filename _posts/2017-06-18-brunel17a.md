title: Rates of estimation for determinantal point processes
abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have wide-ranging applications in machine
  learning, where they are used to enforce the notion of diversity in subset selection
  problems. Many estimators have been proposed, but surprisingly the basic properties
  of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) have received little attention. In this
  paper, we study the local geometry of the expected log-likelihood function to prove
  several rates of convergence for the MLE. We also give a complete characterization
  of the case where the MLE converges at a parametric rate. Even in the latter case,
  we also exhibit a potential curse of dimensionality where the asymptotic variance
  of the MLE is exponentially large in the dimension of the problem.
