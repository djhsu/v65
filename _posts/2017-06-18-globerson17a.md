title: Effective Semisupervised Learning on Manifolds
abstract: The abundance of unlabeled data makes semi-supervised learning (SSL) an
  attractive approach for improving the accuracy of learning systems. However, we
  are still far from a complete theoretical understanding of the benefits of this
  learning scenario in terms of sample complexity. In particular, for many natural
  learning settings it can in fact be shown that SSL does not improve sample complexity.
  Thus far, the only case where SSL provably helps, without compatibility assumptions,
  is a recent combinatorial construction of Darnstadt et al. Deriving similar theoretical
  guarantees for more commonly used approaches to SSL remains a challenge. Here, we
  provide the first analysis of manifold based SSL, where there is a provable gap
  between supervised learning and SSL, and this gap can be arbitrarily large. Proving
  the required lower bound is a technical challenge, involving tools from geometric
  measure theory. The algorithm we analyse is similar to subspace clustering, and
  thus our results demonstrate that this method can be used to improve sample complexity.
