title: Sampling from a log-concave distribution with compact support with proximal
  Langevin Monte Carlo
abstract: " This paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis of the Langevin Monte
  Carlo sampling algorithm recently introduced in Durmus et al. (Efficient Bayesian
  computation by proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo: when Langevin meets Moreau, 2016)
  when applied to log-concave probability distributions that are restricted to a convex
  body $\\mathsfK$. This method relies on a regularisation procedure involving the
  Moreau-Yosida envelope of the indicator function associated with $\\mathsfK$. Explicit
  convergence bounds in total variation norm and in Wasserstein distance of order
  $1$ are established. In particular, we show that the complexity of this algorithm
  given a first order oracle is polynomial in the dimension of the state space. Finally,
  some numerical experiments are presented to compare our method with competing MCMC
  approaches from the literature."
