title: The Price of Selection in Differential Privacy
abstract: 'In the differentially private top-$k$ selection problem, we are given a
  dataset $X ∈\pmo^n \times d$, in which each row belongs to an individual and each
  column corresponds to some binary attribute, and our goal is to find a set of $k
  ≪d$ columns whose means are approximately as large as possible.  Differential privacy
  requires that our choice of these $k$ columns does not depend too much on any on
  individual’s dataset.  This problem can be solved using the well known exponential
  mechanism and composition properties of differential privacy.  In the high-accuracy
  regime, where we require the error of the selection procedure to be to be smaller
  than the so-called sampling error $α≈\sqrt\ln(d)/n$, this procedure succeeds given
  a dataset of size $n ≳k \ln(d)$. We prove a matching lower bound, showing that a
  dataset of size $n ≳k \ln(d)$ is necessary for private top-$k$ selection in this
  high-accuracy regime.  Our lower bound shows that selecting the $k$ largest columns
  requires more data than simply estimating the value of those $k$ columns, which
  can be done using a dataset of size just $n ≳k$. '
