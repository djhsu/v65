title: Matrix Completion from $O(n)$ Samples in Linear Time
abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a rank-$k$ $n \times n$ matrix
  $M$ from a sampling of its entries. Under a certain incoherence assumption on $M$
  and for the case when both the  rank and the condition number of $M$ are bounded,
  it was shown in (Candès and Recht, 2009; Candès and Tao, 2010; Keshavan et al.,
  2010; Recht, 2011; Jain et al., 2012; Hardt, 2014) that $M$ can be recovered exactly
  or approximately (depending on some trade-off between accuracy and computational
  complexity) using $O(n  \textpoly(\log n))$ samples in super-linear time $O(n^a
   \textpoly(\log n))$ for some constant $a ≥1$. In this paper, we propose a new matrix
  completion algorithm using a novel sampling scheme based on a union of independent
  sparse random regular bipartite graphs. We show that under the same conditions w.h.p.
  our algorithm recovers an $ε$-approximation of $M$ in terms of the Frobenius norm
  using $O(n \log^2(1/ε))$ samples and in linear time $O(n \log^2(1/ε))$. This provides
  the best known bounds both on the sample complexity and computational cost for reconstructing
  (approximately) an unknown low-rank matrix. The novelty of  our algorithm  is two
  new steps of thresholding singular values and rescaling singular vectors in the
  application of the “vanilla” alternating minimization algorithm. The structure of
  sparse random regular graphs is used heavily for controlling the impact of these
  regularization steps.
