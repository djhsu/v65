title: Reliably Learning the ReLU in Polynomial Time
abstract: 'We give the first dimension-efficient algorithms for learning Rectified
  Linear Units (ReLUs), which are functions of the form $\mathbfx \mapsto \mathsfmax(0,
   \mathbfw ⋅\mathbfx)$ with $\mathbfw ∈\mathbbS^n-1$. Our algorithm works in the
  challenging Reliable Agnostic learning model of Kalai, Kanade and Mansour (2012)
  where the learner is given access to a distribution $\mathcalD$ on labeled examples
  but the labeling may be arbitrary.  We construct a hypothesis that simultaneously
  minimizes the false-positive rate and the loss on inputs given positive labels by
  $\mathcalD$, for any convex, bounded, and Lipschitz loss function. The algorithm
  runs in polynomial-time (in $n$) with respect to \em any distribution on $\mathbbS^n-1$
  (the unit sphere in $n$ dimensions) and for any error parameter $ε= Ω(1 / \log n)$
  (this yields a PTAS for a question raised by F. Bach on the complexity of maximizing
  ReLUs).  These results are in contrast to known efficient algorithms for reliably
  learning linear threshold functions, where $ε$ must be $Ω(1)$ and strong assumptions
  are required on the marginal distribution. We can compose our results to obtain
  the first set of efficient algorithms for learning constant-depth networks of ReLU
  with fixed polynomial-dependence in the dimension. For depth-2 networks of sigmoids,
  we obtain the first algorithms that have a polynomial dependency in \em all parameters.
  Our techniques combine kernel methods and polynomial approximations with a “dual-loss”
  approach to convex programming. As a byproduct we obtain a number of applications
  including the first set of efficient algorithms for “convex piecewise-linear fitting”
  and the first efficient algorithms for noisy polynomial reconstruction of low-weight
  polynomials on the unit sphere. '
