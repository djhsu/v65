title: Predicting with Distributions
abstract: "  We consider a new learning model in which a joint distribution over vector
  pairs $(x,y)$ is determined by an unknown function $c(x)$ that maps input vectors
  $x$ not to individual outputs, but to entire \\em distributions\\/ over output vectors
  $y$.  Our main results take the form of rather general reductions from our model
  to algorithms for PAC learning the function class and the distribution class separately,
  and show that virtually every such combination yields an efficient algorithm in
  our model.  Our methods include a randomized reduction to classification noise and
  an application of Le Camâ€™s method to obtain robust learning algorithms."
