title: Learning-Theoretic Foundations of Algorithm Configuration for Combinatorial
  Partitioning Problems
abstract: 'Max-cut, clustering, and many other partitioning problems that are of significant
  importance to machine learning and other scientific fields are NP-hard, a reality
  that has motivated researchers to develop a wealth of approximation algorithms and
  heuristics. Although the best algorithm to use typically depends on the specific
  application domain, a worst-case analysis is often used to compare algorithms. This
  may be misleading if worst-case instances occur infrequently, and thus there is
  a demand for optimization methods which return the algorithm configuration best
  suited for the given applicationâ€™s typical inputs. Recently, Gupta and Roughgarden
  introduced the first learning-theoretic framework to rigorously study this problem,
  using it to analyze classes of greedy heuristics, parameter tuning in gradient descent,
  and other problems. We study this algorithm configuration problem for clustering,
  max-cut, and other partitioning problems, such as integer quadratic programming,
  by designing computationally efficient and sample efficient learning algorithms
  which receive samples from an application-specific distribution over problem instances
  and learn a partitioning algorithm with high expected performance. Our algorithms
  learn over common integer quadratic programming and clustering algorithm families:
  SDP rounding algorithms and agglomerative clustering algorithms with dynamic programming.
  For our sample complexity analysis, we provide tight bounds on the pseudodimension
  of these algorithm classes,  and show that surprisingly, even for classes of algorithms
  parameterized by a single parameter, the pseudo-dimension is superconstant. In this
  way, our work both contributes to the foundations of algorithm configuration and
  pushes the boundaries of learning theory, since the algorithm classes we analyze
  consist of multi-stage optimization procedures and are significantly more complex
  than classes typically studied in learning theory.'
