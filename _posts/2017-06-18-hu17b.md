title: A Unified Analysis of Stochastic Optimization Methods Using Jump System Theory
  and Quadratic Constraints
abstract: We develop a simple routine unifying the analysis of several important recently-developed
  stochastic optimization methods including SAGA, Finito, and stochastic dual coordinate
  ascent (SDCA). First, we show an intrinsic connection between stochastic optimization
  methods and dynamic jump systems, and propose a general jump system model for stochastic
  optimization methods. Our proposed model recovers SAGA, SDCA, Finito, and SAG as
  special cases. Then we combine jump system theory with several simple quadratic
  inequalities to derive sufficient conditions for convergence rate certifications
  of the proposed jump system model under various assumptions (with or without individual
  convexity, etc). The derived conditions are linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose
  size roughly scale with the size of the training set. We make use of the symmetry
  in the stochastic optimization methods and reduce these LMIs to some equivalent
  small LMIs whose sizes are at most 3 by 3. We solve these small LMIs to provide
  analytical proofs of new convergence rates for SAGA, Finito and SDCA (with or without
  individual convexity). We also explain why our proposed LMI fails in analyzing SAG.
  We reveal a key difference between SAG and other methods, and briefly discuss how
  to extend our LMI analysis for SAG. An advantage of our approach is that the proposed
  analysis can be automated for a large class of stochastic methods under various
  assumptions (with or without individual convexity, etc).
