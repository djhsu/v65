title: Thresholding Based Outlier Robust PCA
abstract: 'We consider the problem of outlier robust PCA (\textbfOR-PCA) where the
  goal is to recover principal directions despite the presence of outlier data points.
  That is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-α)$ fraction of the points are noisy
  samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $α$ fraction of the points can be
  arbitrary outliers, the goal is to recover the subspace accurately. Existing results
  for \textbfOR-PCA have serious drawbacks: while some results are quite weak in the
  presence of noise, other results have runtime quadratic in dimension, rendering
  them impractical for large scale applications. In this work, we provide a novel
  thresholding based iterative algorithm with per-iteration complexity at most linear
  in the data size. Moreover, the fraction of outliers, $α$, that our method can handle
  is tight up to constants while providing nearly optimal computational complexity
  for a general noise setting. For the special case where the inliers are obtained
  from a low-dimensional subspace with additive Gaussian noise, we show that a modification
  of our thresholding based method leads to significant improvement in recovery error
  (of the subspace) even in the presence of a large fraction of outliers.'
