title: On the Ability of Neural Nets to Express Distributions
abstract: Deep neural nets have caused a revolution in many classification tasks.
  A related ongoing revolution—also theoretically not understood—concerns their ability
  to serve as generative models for complicated types of data such as images and texts.
  These models are trained using ideas like variational autoencoders and Generative
  Adversarial Networks. We take a first cut at explaining the expressivity of multilayer
  nets by giving a sufficient criterion for a function to be approximable by a neural
  network with $n$ hidden layers. A key ingredient is Barron’s Theorem (Barron, 1993),
  which gives a Fourier criterion for approximability of a function by a neural network
  with 1 hidden layer. We show that a composition of $n$ functions which satisfy certain
  Fourier conditions (“Barron functions”) can be approximated by a $n+1$-layer neural
  network. For probability distributions, this translates into a criterion for a probability
  distribution to be approximable in Wasserstein distance—a natural metric on probability
  distributions—by a neural network applied to a fixed base distribution (e.g., multivariate
  gaussian). Building up recent lower bound work, we also give an example function
  that shows that composition of Barron functions is more expressive than Barron functions
  alone.
