title: Efficient Co-Training of Linear Separators under Weak Dependence
abstract: We develop the first polynomial-time algorithm for co-training of homogeneous
  linear separators under \em weak dependence, a relaxation of the condition of independence
  given the label. Our algorithm learns from purely unlabeled data, except for a single
  labeled example to break symmetry of the two classes, and works for any data distribution
  having an inverse-polynomial margin and with center of mass at the origin.
