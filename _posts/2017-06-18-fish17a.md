title: 'Open Problem: Meeting Times for Learning Random Automata'
abstract: Learning automata is a foundational problem in computational learning theory.
  However, even efficiently learning random DFAs is hard. A natural restriction of
  this problem is to consider learning random DFAs under the uniform distribution.
  To date, this problem has no non-trivial lower bounds nor algorithms faster than
  brute force. In this note, we propose a method to find faster algorithms for this
  problem. We reduce the learning problem to a conjecture about meeting times of random
  walks over random DFAs, which may be of independent interest to prove.
