title: Fast Rates for Empirical Risk Minimization of Strict Saddle Problems
abstract: We derive bounds on the sample complexity of empirical risk minimization
  (ERM) in the context of minimizing non-convex risks that admit the strict saddle
  property. Recent progress in non-convex optimization has yielded efficient algorithms
  for minimizing such functions. Our results imply that these efficient algorithms
  are statistically stable and also generalize well. In particular, we derive fast
  rates which resemble the bounds that are often attained in the strongly convex setting.
  We specify our bounds to Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component
  Analysis. Our results and techniques may pave the way for statistical analyses of
  additional strict saddle problems.
