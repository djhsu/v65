title: On Equivalence of Martingale Tail Bounds and Deterministic Regret Inequalities
abstract: 'We study an equivalence of (i) deterministic pathwise statements appearing
  in the online learning literature (termed \emphregret bounds), (ii) high-probability
  tail bounds for the supremum of a collection of martingales (of a specific form
  arising from uniform laws of large numbers), and (iii) in-expectation bounds for
  the supremum. By virtue of the equivalence, we prove exponential tail bounds for
  norms of Banach space valued martingales via deterministic regret bounds for the
  online mirror descent algorithm with an adaptive step size. We show that the phenomenon
  extends beyond the setting of online linear optimization and present the equivalence
  for the supervised online learning setting. '
