title: A General Characterization of the Statistical Query Complexity
abstract: Statistical query (SQ) algorithms  are algorithms that have access to an
  \em SQ oracle for the input distribution $D$ instead of i.i.d. samples from $D$.
  Given a query function $φ:X \to [-1,1]$, the oracle returns an estimate of $\bf
  E_x∼D[φ(x)]$ within some tolerance $\tau_φ$ that roughly corresponds to the number
  of samples. In this work we demonstrate that the complexity of solving an arbitrary
  statistical problem using SQ algorithms can be captured by a relatively simple notion
  of statistical dimension that we introduce. SQ algorithms capture a broad spectrum
  of algorithmic approaches used in theory and practice, most notably, convex optimization
  techniques. Hence our statistical dimension allows to investigate the power of a
  variety of algorithmic approaches by analyzing a single linear-algebraic parameter.  Such
  characterizations were investigated over the past 20 years in learning theory but
  prior characterizations are restricted to the much simpler setting of classification
  problems relative to a fixed distribution on the domain.  Our characterization is
  also the first to precisely characterize the necessary tolerance of queries.  We
  give applications of our techniques to two open problems in learning theory and
  to algorithms that are subject to memory and communication constraints.
