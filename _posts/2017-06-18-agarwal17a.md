title: 'Open Problem: First-Order Regret Bounds for Contextual Bandits'
abstract: 'We describe two open problems related to first order regret bounds for
  contextual bandits. The first asks for an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{L_⋆}K
  \ln N)$ where there are $K$ actions, $N$ policies, and $L_⋆$ is the cumulative loss
  of the best policy. The second asks for an optimization-oracle-efficient algorithm
  with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(L_⋆^{2/3}poly(K, \ln(N/δ)))$.  We describe
  some positive results, such as an inefficient algorithm for the second problem,
  and some partial negative results. '
