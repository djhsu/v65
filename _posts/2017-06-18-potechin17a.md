title: Exact tensor completion with sum-of-squares
abstract: We obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm for exact tensor completion
  that improves over the bound implied by reduction to matrix completion. The algorithm
  recovers an unknown 3-tensor with $r$ incoherent, orthogonal components in $\mathbb
  R^n$ from $r⋅\tilde O(n^1.5)$ randomly observed entries of the tensor. This bound
  improves over the previous best one of $r⋅\tilde O(n^2)$ by reduction to exact matrix
  completion. Our bound also matches the best known results for the easier problem
  of approximate tensor completion (Barak & Moitra, 2015). Our algorithm and analysis
  extends seminal results for exact matrix completion (Candes & Recht, 2009) to the
  tensor setting via the sum-of-squares method. The main technical challenge is to
  show that a small number of randomly chosen monomials are enough to construct a
  degree-3 polynomial with precisely planted orthogonal global optima over the sphere
  and that this fact can be certified within the sum-of-squares proof system.
