title: Algorithmic Chaining and the Role of Partial Feedback in Online Nonparametric
  Learning
abstract: We investigate contextual online learning with nonparametric (Lipschitz)
  comparison classes under different assumptions on losses and feedback information.
  For full information feedback and Lipschitz losses, we design the first explicit
  algorithm achieving the minimax regret rate (up to log factors). In a partial feedback
  model motivated by second-price auctions, we obtain algorithms for Lipschitz and
  semi-Lipschitz losses with regret bounds improving on the known bounds for standard
  bandit feedback. Our analysis combines novel results for contextual second-price
  auctions with a novel algorithmic approach based on chaining. When the context space
  is Euclidean, our chaining approach is efficient and delivers an even better regret
  bound.
