title: Learning Disjunctions of Predicates
abstract: 'Let $\mathcal F$ be a set of boolean functions. We give an algorithm for
  learning $\mathcal F_∨:={\vee_f∈Sf | S⊆\mathcal {F}}$ from membership queries. Our
  algorithm asks at most $|\mathcal {F}|⋅\rm OPT(\mathcal {F}_∨)$ membership queries where
  $\rm OPT(\mathcal{F}_∨)$ is the minimum worst case number of membership queries for
  learning $\mathcal{F}_∨$. When $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of halfspaces over a constant
  dimension space or a set of variable inequalities, our algorithm runs in polynomial
  time. The problem we address has a practical importance in the field of program
  synthesis, where the goal is to synthesize a program meeting some requirements.
  Program synthesis has become popular especially in settings aimed to help end users.
  In such settings, the requirements are not provided upfront and the synthesizer
  can only learn them by posing membership queries to the end user. Our work completes
  such synthesizers with the ability to learn the exact requirements while bounding
  the number of membership queries. '
