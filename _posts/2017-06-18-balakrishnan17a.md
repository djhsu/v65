title: Computationally Efficient Robust Sparse Estimation in High Dimensions
abstract: Many conventional statistical procedures are extremely sensitive to seemingly
  minor deviations from modeling assumptions. This problem is exacerbated in modern
  high-dimensional settings, where the problem dimension can grow with and possibly
  exceed the sample size.  We consider the problem of \emphrobust estimation of sparse
  functionals, and  provide a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm
  in the high-dimensional setting. Our theory identifies a unified set of deterministic
  conditions under which our algorithm guarantees accurate recovery.  By further establishing
  that these deterministic conditions hold with high-probability for a wide range
  of statistical models, our theory applies to many problems of considerable interest
  including sparse mean and covariance estimation; sparse linear regression; and sparse
  generalized linear models. In certain settings, such as the detection and estimation
  of sparse principal components in  the spiked covariance model, our general theory
  does not yield optimal sample complexity, and we provide a novel algorithm based
  on the same intuition which is able to take advantage of further structure of the
  problem to achieve nearly optimal rates.
