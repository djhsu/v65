title: An Improved Parametrization and Analysis of the EXP3++ Algorithm for Stochastic
  and Adversarial Bandits
abstract: We present a new strategy for gap estimation in randomized algorithms for
  multiarmed bandits and combine it with the EXP3++ algorithm of Seldin and Slivkins
  (2014). In the stochastic regime the strategy reduces dependence of regret on a
  time horizon from $(\ln t)^3$ to $(\ln t)^2$ and eliminates an additive factor of
  order $∆e^1/∆^2$, where $∆$ is the minimal gap of a problem instance. In the adversarial
  regime regret guarantee remains unchanged.
