title: Memory and Communication Efficient Distributed Stochastic Optimization with
  Minibatch Prox
abstract: We present and analyze statistically optimal, communication and memory efficient
  distributed stochastic optimization algorithms with near-linear speedups (up to
  $\log$-factors).  This improves over prior work which includes methods with near-linear
  speedups but polynomial communication requirements (accelerated minibatch SGD) and
  communication efficient methods which do not exhibit any runtime speedups over a
  naive single-machine approach.  We first analyze a distributed SVRG variant as a
  distributed stochastic optimization method and show that it can achieve near-linear
  speedups with logarithmic rounds of communication, at the cost of high memory requirements.
  We then present a novel method, MB-DSVRG, which trades off memory for communication
  and still allows for optimization with communication which scales only logarithmically
  with the desired accuracy while also being memory efficient.  MB-DSVRG is based
  on a minibatch prox procedure, solving a non-linearized subproblem on a minibatch
  at each iteration.  We provide a novel analysis for this procedure which achieves
  the statistical optimal rate regardless of minibatch size and smoothness, and thus
  significantly improving on prior work.
