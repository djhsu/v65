title: Correspondence retrieval
abstract: 'This article studies the correspondence retrieval problem: a set of $k$
  distinct but unknown points $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dotsc, \mathbf{x}_k ∈\mathbb{R}^d$
  are to be recovered from the unordered collection of projection values $⟨\mathbf{w}_i,\mathbf{x}_1
  ⟩, ⟨\mathbf{w}_i,\mathbf{x}_2 ⟩, \dotsc, ⟨\mathbf{w}_i,\mathbf{x}_k ⟩$ onto $n$ known measurement
  vectors $\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \dotsc, \mathbf{w}_n$.  Importantly, the correspondence
  of the $k$ projections ${⟨\mathbf{w}_i,\mathbf{x}_j ⟩}_j=1^k$ across different measurements
  is unknown.  A special case of this problem is the well-studied problem of (real-valued)
  phase retrieval.  In the case of independent standard Gaussian measurement vectors,
  the main algorithm proposed in this work requires $n = d+1$ measurements to correctly
  return the $k$ unknown points with high probability.  This number of measurements
  is optimal, and it is smaller than the number of measurements required for a stronger
  “for all” guarantee even in the phase retrieval setting.  The algorithm is based
  on reductions to the Shortest Vector Problem on certain random lattices, and employs
  the Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovász (1982) basis reduction algorithm in a manner similar
  to the Lagarias & Odlyzko (1985) algorithm for solving random instances of Subset
  Sum.  Another algorithm, essentially due to Yi, Caramanis, & Sanghavi (2016), based
  on higher-order moments and tensor decompositions is shown to work in a setting
  where the projection values are corrupted by additive Gaussian noise, but it requires
  a significantly larger number of measurements.'
