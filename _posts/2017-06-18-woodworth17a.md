title: Learning Non-Discriminatory Predictors
abstract: We consider learning a predictor which is non-discriminatory with respect
  to a “protected attribute” according to the notion of “equalized odds” proposed
  by Hardt et al. (2016).  We study the problem of learning such a non-discriminatory
  predictor from a finite training set, both statistically and computationally.  We
  show that a post-hoc correction approach, as suggested by Hardt et al, can be highly
  suboptimal, present a nearly-optimal statistical procedure, argue that the associated
  computational problem is intractable, and suggest a second moment relaxation of
  the non-discrimination definition for which learning is tractable.
