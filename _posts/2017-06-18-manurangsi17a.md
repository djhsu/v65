title: Inapproximability of VC Dimension and Littlestone’s Dimension
abstract: We study the complexity of computing the VC Dimension and Littlestone’s
  Dimension. Given an explicit description of a finite universe and a concept class
  (a binary matrix whose $(x,C)$-th entry is $1$ iff element $x$ belongs to concept
  $C$), both can be computed exactly in quasi-polynomial time ($n^O(\log n)$). Assuming
  the randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we prove nearly matching lower
  bounds on the running time, that hold even for \em approximation algorithms.
