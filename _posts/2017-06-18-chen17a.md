title: Nearly Optimal Sampling Algorithms for Combinatorial Pure Exploration
abstract: " We study the combinatorial pure exploration problem \\textscBest-Set in
  a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. In an \\textscBest-Set instance, we are given
  $n$ stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as a family $\\mathcalF$
  of feasible subsets over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean of its reward
  distribution. Our goal is to identify the feasible subset in $\\mathcalF$ with the
  maximum total weight, using as few samples as possible. The problem generalizes
  the classical best arm identification problem and the top-$k$ arm identification
  problem, both of which have attracted significant attention in recent years. We
  provide a novel \\textitinstance-wise lower bound for the sample complexity of the
  problem, as well as a nontrivial sampling algorithm, matching the lower bound up
  to a factor of $\\ln|\\mathcalF|$. For an important class of combinatorial families
  (including spanning trees, matchings, and path constraints), we also provide polynomial
  time implementation of the sampling algorithm, using the equivalence of separation
  and optimization for convex program, and the notion of approximate Pareto curves
  in multi-objective optimization (note that $|\\mathcalF|$ can be exponential in
  $n$). We also show that the $\\ln|\\mathcalF|$ factor is inevitable in general,
  through a nontrivial lower bound construction utilizing a combinatorial structure
  resembling the Nisan-Wigderson design. Our results significantly improve several
  previous results for several important combinatorial constraints, and provide a
  tighter understanding of the general \\textscBest-Set problem. We further introduce
  an even more general problem, formulated in geometric terms. We are given $n$ Gaussian
  arms with unknown means and unit variance. Consider the $n$-dimensional Euclidean
  space $\\mathbbR^n$, and a collection $\\mathcalO$ of disjoint subsets. Our goal
  is to determine the subset in $\\mathcalO$ that contains the mean profile (which
  is the $n$-dimensional vector of the means), using as few samples as possible. The
  problem generalizes most pure exploration bandit problems studied in the literature.
  We provide the first nearly optimal sample complexity upper and lower bounds for
  the problem. "
